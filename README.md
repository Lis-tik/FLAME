# 🎬 Muxon

**Muxon** is a cross-platform GUI tool for convenient interaction with media files.  
It allows you to create projects, edit metadata, manage tracks and subtitles, as well as configure and monitor the conversion process (powered by **FFmpeg**).  

> While initially focused on DASH and HLS, Muxon is designed to be a universal media processing tool.
